Assessment 2 - Object Orientation & CSV
-------------------------------------
## Time Limit: 4 hours
You have two challenges for today's assessments that test two different skillsets: 
- [Apple Orchards](https://github.com/kiloplatoon/assessment-2/tree/master/apple_orchards) will test you on Object Orientation and writing unit tests
- [Military Recruits](https://github.com/kiloplatoon/assessment-2/tree/master/military_recruits) will test if you know how to read/write to a CSV file

Feel free to use any resources you'd like (Google, Youtube, old videos, old challenges, etc.). The only limitation is that you cannot ask each other for help. Good luck and let us know if you have any questions!
